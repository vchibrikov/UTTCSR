# UTTCSR
UTTCSR (Uniaxial Tensile Tests with Constant Strain Rate) - repository of Python and R scripts for tensile test data processing, analysis and visualization. Scripts allows to plot and smooth input data, evaluate slopes of Young's and strain hardening moduli, forces/stresses and elongations/strains at various stages (start, elastic limit, maximum).
